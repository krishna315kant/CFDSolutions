    <h2>Teaching and Training</h2>
    <p>As an experienced researcher in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and related fields, I offer a variety of teaching and training services for students, professionals, and institutions. These services are designed to introduce, educate, and advance understanding of CFD and multiphase flow dynamics. My goal is to help students and professionals gain hands-on experience and theoretical knowledge that will benefit their careers.</p>

    <h3>Courses and Workshops</h3>
    <p>Here are the courses and workshops I offer:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Introduction to CFD:</strong> A beginner-friendly course that covers the basics of Computational Fluid Dynamics, including its applications in various industries.</li>
        <li><strong>Advanced CFD Modeling:</strong> A deeper dive into the advanced topics in CFD, including turbulence modeling, multiphase flows, and transient simulations.</li>
        <li><strong>CFD for Industry:</strong> Tailored workshops focused on how CFD is used in specific industries such as aerospace, automotive, and energy.</li>
        <li><strong>Hands-on CFD Training:</strong> A practical, project-based workshop that allows participants to run their simulations using industry-standard CFD software.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Academic Mentoring and Supervision</h3>
    <p>I also offer mentoring and supervision for students working on research projects or theses in CFD, thermodynamics, and multiphase flow. My experience in both academic research and industrial applications allows me to guide students through the complexities of real-world problems, helping them develop the necessary skills for successful careers in research and industry.</p>

    <h3>Online Learning Resources</h3>
    <p>For those who are unable to attend in-person courses or workshops, I provide online learning resources, including video lectures, reading materials, and problem sets. These resources are designed to complement traditional learning and help students reinforce their understanding of key concepts in CFD.</p>

    <h3>Get in Touch for Teaching Opportunities</h3>
    <p>If you're interested in any of the courses or workshops mentioned, or if you're seeking mentorship for academic projects, please feel free to contact me. I'd be happy to discuss how I can support your educational goals.</p>
